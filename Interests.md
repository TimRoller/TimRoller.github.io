## Data Science 

Apophenia is the human tendency to perceive meaningful patterns from randomn data. A visual representation of this is the apparent skull in the flower below:

The explanation put forth by evolutionary psychologists for apophenia is that it is not a defect of human cognition, but selected for. This is due to the asymmetrical cost of Type I and Type II (not recognizing a pattern that does exist) errors. For example, someone might hear a noise that sounds like a predator growling. If he believes that it is a predator, but it's just the wind, the cost is only losing a moment's travel time to stand on guard. If he believes that it is just the wind and it actually is predator, the cost is his life.[1]
