  Hey! Welcome to my personal homepage! You'll find a brief history about me, some areas of research, and whatever else I decide to add over time. Thanks for stopping by!

## Bio

I grew up in North Hollywood, CA, the youngest of three boys. We all played sports from a very young age, with intense sibiling rivalries  across basketball, soccer and volleyball. After high school, I ventured north to Cal for Civil Engineering, receiving a BS and MS in 2007 and 2008. 

I spent two summers interning for a Consulting Engineering firm, SGH, before embarking on a career in Finance. I started out as a market maker for equity options, quoting over 100 stocks and etfs electronically, from the floor of the Pacific Exchange. Next, I worked 3 years as a trader for a New York-based Hedge Fund, Saiers Captial, that specialized in Volatility Arbitrage.  More recently, I used quantitative methods to evaluate equity investments for a Family Office.

In 2014, I receieved the CFA designation, and am a memeber of the CFA Society of San Francisco. 

In my free time I've been developing software in Python, posting it to GitHub, and of course, playing basketball at Cal. 

Thanks for reading!
