## Bio

I grew up in North Hollywood, CA, the youngest of three boys. We all played sports from a very young age, with intense sibiling rivalries across basketball, soccer and volleyball. After high school, I ventured north to Cal for Civil Engineering, receiving a BS and MS in 2007 and 2008. 

I spent two summers interning for a Consulting Engineering firm before embarking on a career in Finance. I started out as a market maker in equity options, quoting over 100 stocks and ETFs from the floor of the Pacific Exchange before moving to a New York-based Hedge Fund that specialized in volatility arbitrage.

In 2014, I receieved the CFA designation, and became a memeber of the CFA Society of San Francisco. I then developed equity and quantitative research for a $100Mn family office in San Mateo focused on Biotech and momentum strategies. 

More recently, I engineered analytics and reporting for a heavily regulated Bank using python and jupyter notebook. 

I've also enojoyed developing crypto portfolio analytics in python and uploading them to my <a href="https://github.com/TimRoller/Crypto-Portfolio-Analytics">GitHub</a> page. In addition, it's been both challenging and rewarding to push my knowledge of SQL and data analytics. 

In my free time I try to play as much basketball as much as possible, and get outside with my dog, Sierra. 

Thanks for reading!
