## Bio

I grew up in North Hollywood, CA, the youngest of three boys. We all played sports from a very young age, with intense sibiling rivalries  across basketball, soccer and volleyball. After highschool I ventured north to Cal for Civil Engineering, receiving a BS and MS in 2007 and 2008. 

I spent two summers interning for a Consuling Engineering firm, SGH, before emarking on a career in Finance. I started out as a market maker for equity options in SF, quoting over 100 stocks and etfs electronically, from the Pacific Exchange Floor. Next, I worked 3 years as a trader for a New York based Hedge Fund, Saiers Captial, that specializes in Volitility Arbitrage.  More recently, I used quantitative methods to evaluate equity investments for a Family Office.

In 2014 I receienved the CFA designation, and am a memeber of the CFA Society of San Francisco. 

In my free time I've been developing software in Python, posting it to GitHub, and ofcourse playing basketball at Cal.
