## Bio

I grew up in North Hollywood, CA, the youngest of three boys. We all played sports from a very young age, with intense sibiling rivalries across basketball, soccer and volleyball. After high school, I ventured north to Cal for Civil Engineering, receiving a BS and MS in 2007 and 2008. 

I spent two summers interning for a Consulting Engineering firm, SGH, before embarking on a career in Finance. I started out as a market maker for equity options, quoting over 100 stocks and etfs electronically, from the floor of the Pacific Exchange. Next, I worked 3 years as a trader for a New York-based Hedge Fund, Saiers Captial, that specialized in Volatility Arbitrage.  More recently, I used quantitative methods to evaluate equity investments for a Family Office.

In 2014, I receieved the CFA designation, and am a memeber of the CFA Society of San Francisco. I then worked in San Mateo evaluating equity investments for a Family Office. More recently, I engineered analytics and reporting operations for a heavily regulated Bank. 

In my free time I've been developing software in Python around crypto (<a href="https://github.com/TimRoller/Crypto-Portfolio-Analytics"> GitHub Repo </a>) and playing basketball whenever I can.
